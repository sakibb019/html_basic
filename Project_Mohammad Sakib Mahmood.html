														<b>Rajshahi</b>, 
														formerly Rampur Boalia city, west center Bangladesh. It lies just north of the upper Padma River and the border with the West Bengal state of India. Rajshahi was selected by the Dutch in the early 18th Century as the site of a factory and was constituted a municipality under the British in 1876. Now Industrial Centre, it produces silk, timber, and processed agricultural products. It has several public hospitals, dozens of private hospitals and clinics, the Virendra Research Museum, a sericulture institute, the University of Rajshahi (RU), Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET). To the northwest of Rajshahi lies the elevated and undulating Brind region; to the south is the high, well-drained Padma river valley; and a swampy depression drains the land near the city. Among the chief crops in the area are rice, wheat, jute, and sugarcane. The regionâ€™s sericulture accounts for almost the entire silk output of Bangladesh. Cottage industries include weaving, metalworking and woodworking, and pottery. The region is believed to have formed part of the old pundra kingdom, the country of pods, whose capital was at Mahasthan.

														<h3>
															Puthia Temple Complex
														</h3>
															<p>
																The Puthia Temple Complex consists of a cluster of notable old Hindu temples in Puthia Upazila, Rajshahi District, Bangladesh. Located 23 km to the east of Rajshahi city, it has the largest number of historic temples in Bangladesh. The temples were built by Hindu Zamindars Rajas of the Puthia Raj family who were noted philanthropists of Rajshahi. The temples have been built in terracotta in a variety of styles combining the typical Jor-bangla architecture with other influences. The Rajbari or Palace of the Raja of Puthia and the Dol Mancha are part of the complex. The temples are laid out around a lake with a sprawling lawn.The Puthia Raj family was established by a holy man named Bhatsacharya, who lived in the 16th century.

														<h3>
															Varendra Research Museum
														</h3>
															<p>
																Varendra Museum is a museum, research centre, and popular visitor attraction at the heart of Rajshahi and maintained by Rajshahi University in Bangladesh. It is considered the oldest museum in Bangladesh. It was the first museum to be established in East Bengal in 1910. The museum started out as the collection for Varendra Anushandan Samiti (or Varendra Investigation Society) and got its current name in 1919. The Rajahs of Rajshahi and Natore, notably prince Sharat Kumar Ray, donated their personal collections to Varendra Museum. Varendra refers to an ancient Janapada roughly corresponding to modern northern Bangladesh.

														<h3>
															Choto Sona Mosque	
														</h3>
															<p>
																The mosque is one of the best-preserved Sultanate monuments under the protection of the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Bangladesh. The gilding employed in the ornamentation that has given the building its appellation Chhota Sona Masjid (Small Golden Mosque) does not exist now. An outer wall originally surrounded the mosque premise, which covers an area of 42m from east to west and 43m from north to south, with a gateway in the middle of the east side. Leaving only the gateway, the entire surrounding wall has completely disappeared, but its trace can still be clearly detected at places. Barbed wire fencing has now been erected in line with the original enclosure wall. Local people report that near the gateway, there was originally a stepped masonry ghat with approaches from the south.

															Bagha Mosque
														</h3>
															<p>
																Bagha Mosque situated at Bagha, about 40km southeast of Rajshahi town, survives in a fairly good state of preservation. The mosque was built on the western bank of a fairly large tank within a brick-walled compound, 48.77m square. The mosque compound could be entered by two old arched gateways - one on the north and the main one on the south comprising a simple oblong curved structure with a turret on either side. This brick-built mosque, now a protected monument of the Department of Archaeology, Bangladesh, is an oblong structure measuring externally about 23.16m by 12.80m.The four exterior angles of the building are emphasised with octagonal towers, divided into sections by moulded bands and topped over with polygonal solid cupolas. The cornice of the building is gently curved in the Bengali fashion.
